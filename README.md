## Hello, my name is Daniel Jara. I am a Data Scientist with over 2 years of experience in analytics, industrial engineering, and manufacturing process implementation across multiple departments, service lines, and industries. I have experience with project research and project implementation that encompasses complex engineering and technical software program utilization and data procurement, the results of which drive and impact analytical and organizational decisions, goals, and imperatives.

## I graduated from Oklahoma State University, who has one of the top 10 data science masters level programs according to Fortune (https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/best-masters-in-data-science/). 

## This is my github, where I compile some of the projects that I have worked on during my data science journey. Here I only showcase the projects developed in Python, as it is the language that I use the most. However, I have also worked with other programming languages such as R and SAS. Take a look at my repositories.
